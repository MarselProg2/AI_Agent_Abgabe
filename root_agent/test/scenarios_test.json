The hook (0:00-0:03) shows the phone being dropped (shock factor). Visuals include zooming into the titanium frame and camera tests. Audio is upbeat lo-fi. The creator speaks quickly about 'USB-C at last'.",

No speaking, just ambient temple sounds and soft piano music. The hook is a slow-motion falling leaf landing on a stone lantern. The mood is peaceful and nostalgic.",
